# Assignment2

##Proposed Idea
Git repository for OOP assignment 2.
The game I have envisioned is a mix between pong and breakout, designed to be played between two players competitively.

My initial goal is to create working versions of both games so I can get a deeper understanding of their mechanics and how they might work together.

##Overview
This game has three separate modes with four five screens including a menu screen and a pause screen.

* Menu Screen:	Simple splash screen with three options. Options can be selected with the mouse or with the keyboard.

* 1 Player Pong:	Player v Computer Pong

* 2 Player Pong:	Player v Player Pong

* Breakout:		The classic brick breaking game breakout

* Pause Screen:	Simple pause screen with options to pause music, return to game or return to main menu.

##Controls

* Menu: Menu options can either be chosen with [1], [2], [3] or by clicking them with the mouse.

* Player1 Paddle: [A] to move left, [D] to move right.

* Player 2 Paddle: [J] to move left, [L] to move right.

* Pause Menu: [P] to pause music, [R] to resume music, [G] to resume game, [M] to return to Menu.

##Reflections
In the end I was a little too ambitious with what I wanted from this assignment. I managed to get fully working versions of both games working, but due to unforeseen personal circumstances I was unable to merge the two of them into the end result that I wanted.
There were a lot of features I wanted to add to it: Split Screen support, Controller support, Powerups, Different Brick Types etc.

The biggest problem I ran into was collision detection. It was a lot of work to get the ball to bounce one way depending on what part of the paddle it hit, and another way depending on the angle that it hit the brick at.
